# Portfolio Project - React Twitter Clone

This is a portfolio project for a front-end developer who has built a Twitter clone using React. The project's main objective was to build a Twitter clone that looks and feels like Twitter, without using Bootstrap or any other component library.

## Project Overview

The Twitter clone project is a web application built using React.ts, which allows users to interact with a web page that looks and feels like the Twitter interface. The app uses Inspect to gather data about Twitter's interface, such as the CSS styles, HTML structure, and TypeScript code, to build a similar interface.

This project has been developed with the following features:

<!-- - Users can post tweets.  -->
<!-- - Users can reply to other users' tweets. -->
